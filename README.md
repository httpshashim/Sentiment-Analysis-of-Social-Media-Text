## 📊 What We Did

1. **Loaded the Dataset**  
   Used `pandas` to import and inspect a CSV file containing social media text data.

2. **Applied Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Used VADER to score each post.
   - Classified each as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Created a bar chart to show sentiment distribution.
   - Generated WordClouds for each sentiment group.

4. **Saved Results**  
   - Exported the final DataFrame with sentiment labels to a new CSV file.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project helped understand how natural language processing can be used to uncover public opinion patterns from text data. The visualizations make it easier to see which sentiments dominate and what words are frequently used.
